          As a full stack developer, I have a passion for creating functional
          and visually appealing websites.<br />
          I recently graduated through self-study and have completed various<br />
          projects that showcase my skills across multiple technologies.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm a full-stack developer with a degree in business
          administration and specialization in finance and the financial
          market.<br />
          Recently, I completed independent Full Stack Development studies and
          gained proficiency on the client side and on the server side.<br />
          I have a huge hunger for knowledge and love learning new things.
          <br />My diverse background that includes study in a Yeshiva
          throughout my childhood and early adulthood.<br />
          It instilled in me a strong work ethic and dedication to learning that
          have been invaluable throughout my career.<br />
          Because my yeshiva studies were not included traditional subjects such
          as English or math, after I finished studying there, I completed the
          missing studies independently and eventually earned a degree in
          Business Administration.<br />
          I also gained significant experience in my last two positions - owning
          an import company and team manager at Bezeq International. <br />These
          two positions helped me develop skills in project management and
          problem-solving as well as the ability to work in a team and meet
          deadlines.

        Because I learned everything independently through websites such as
        udemy and the courses there are very practical, so I got to do a lot of
        guided projects and in addition at the end of each course I also did an
        independent project on the subject. <br />But here I chose to present
        only projects that I did independently from the idea to the deployment.
        <br />It should be noted that some of the projects I built for payment
        to clients and there of course the idea is not mine but all the
        execution is mine. <br />
        I highly recommend looking at in "Find The Treasury" project which is
        the most creative and incorporates the most technologies.
